Tool intended for switching pre-baked lightmaps at runtime.
This tool is not compatible with unity versions below 5.5, see notes.
If you want to use lightmaps of different resolutions in your different lighting scenarios you will probably need to disable static batching in the PlayerSettings (if the lightmaps atlassing changes you need to disable static batching, if just the lightmaps' scale changes, that's fine).

The system relies on 2 components :
- LevelLightmapData : References the different lighting scenarios, builds the lighting, and stores the dependencies to the lightmaps.
- LightingScenarioSwitcher : This is just an example of asset that calls the LevelLightmapData in order to switch lightmaps at runtime. You could build other components that call the LevelLightmapData in the same way but on different events (like you could use a box trigger running the same script on OnTriggerEnter ).

How it works :
- Make a scene with your static geometry only. Disable Auto baking.
- Make several lighting scenes in a "Scenes" folder (under Assets/ ). These scenes should not contain static geometry (unless you want extra baked shadows). The Lighting scene settings must be : no Auto baking, only baked GI. Your lights in the scene must be baked, see notes.
- In your static geometry scene, add an empty gameObject and attach a LevelLightmapData component to it. 
- Fill the "lighting scenarios size" with the count of lighting scenarios you want, and in the "element" fields, either drag and drop scenes from your Project view or click the little point on the right of the field and choose a scene from your project
- One by one, you can now Build the lighting scenario, and then Store it. You need to do these steps in the lighting scenario order ( you cannot build and store lighting scenario 2 before lighting scenario 1 ). The "Build" and the "Store" steps have not been merged because in some builds ( seen in 5.5.0f1 ) the lightmaps don't load correctly after baking. If you encounter this problem, you need to disable the LightingScenarioSwitcher if there is one in the scene, start game mode, stop game mode, (you should see the lightmaps properly then) and then Store (and re-anable the LightingScenarioSwitcher before you start playing for good).
- Now add an empty Gameobject to your scene and add a LightingScenarioSwitcher for previewing the switch
- The Default lighting scenario field is the ID of the lighting scenario you want to load when you start playing. The ID is the number associated to the lighting scenario in the LevelLightmapData ( ID of "Element 0" is 0 for example )
- Start playing and when clicking ( left mouse button or Fire1 if you have changed the input assignments ) the lightmaps should switch between your different lighting scenarios.

NEW :
- Bugfixes
- Now the lighting scenarios list is no longer strings, it's sceneAssets, so you can directly drag and drop your scene.
- Stores also the lightprobes from your StaticGeometry scene ( the number and position of the lightprobes cannot change between lighting scenarios )
- Refactor, grouped custom wrappers, renamed variables for consistency and clarity

CHANGES :
- The lighting scenarios list needs to reference SceneAssets ( old string values won't work anymore )
- Default lighting scenario moved to LightingScenarioSwitcher so that the LevelLightmapData does not have any runtime logic, all lightmap switches need to be triggered from the switcher.

NOTES : 
- if you want to use unity versions below 5.5, you should at least change the name of the lightmaps in the LevelLightmapData script ( replace lightmapLight and lightmapDir respectively with lightmapNear and lightmapFar, not tested ).
- if you want to use lights that don't have direct lighting baked, then you would need to also load the lighting scene associated with the lightmaps when operating the switch.

TODO :
- Include reflection probes
- Include an example of lighting switching with lights that have baked GI but realtime direct lighting
